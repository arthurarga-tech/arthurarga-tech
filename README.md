# 👋🏽 Hi, I'm Arthur Arga!

💻 QA Analyst | 🎓 Civil Engineer | 🔧 Mechatronics Technician |

---

Since an early age, I've been driven by curiosity and a constant desire to learn — always passionate about technology. I had brief experience in civil engineering during my internship at **MRV Engenharia**, and I also founded **Dom Burguer**, an artisanal burger delivery business in Jesuânia, Brazil.

📍 I’m currently transitioning my career into the tech industry, focusing on **Quality Assurance (QA)**. I studied at **TripleTen**, where I learned and applied both manual and automated testing in hands-on projects, using tools like:

- 🧪 Jira | Postman | Figma  
- 🗃️ SQL | Excel  
- 🌐 HTML | CSS | JavaScript | Python

I'm a huge enthusiast of **artificial intelligence**, often applying AI in daily tasks to boost productivity and creativity.

💡 I believe quality lies in the details — whether it's a line of code, a client delivery, or a real-world problem being solved.
